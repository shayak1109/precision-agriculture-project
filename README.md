# 🌾 Web-Based Precision Agriculture using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

### An Integrated Platform for Crop Recommendation, Fertilizer Suggestion, and Disease Detection

---

## 🧭 Overview

Agriculture in India faces challenges like **poor crop selection**, **inefficient fertilizer use**, and **late disease detection**, leading to lower productivity and financial losses.  
This project introduces an **AI-driven web platform** that integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** to assist farmers through three major modules:

1. 🌱 **Crop Recommendation System** – Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients (NPK), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.  
2. 🌾 **Fertilizer Recommendation System** – Provides fertilizer suggestions by comparing soil nutrient levels with ideal crop requirements.  
3. 🍃 **Disease Detection System** – Identifies plant leaf diseases using a **ResNet-9 CNN** trained on thousands of leaf images.

Developed as part of the **B.E. Minor Project** at **RV College of Engineering (ECE Dept)** under the guidance of **Dr. Veena Devi S.V.**

## 🧪 Features Demonstration

🌱 Crop Recommendation

- Inputs: N, P, K, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and location.

- Output: Recommended crop suitable for the conditions.

🌾 Fertilizer Recommendation

- Inputs: Crop name, N, P, K values.

- Output: Suggests fertilizer corrections and organic alternatives.

🍃 Disease Detection

- Inputs: Image of a crop leaf (JPG/PNG).

- Output: Detects disease and suggests treatment measures.
